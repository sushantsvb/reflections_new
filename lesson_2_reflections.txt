What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A. When we initialize a repository a .git file is created in the directory which we want to track.
   
   We want to track the changes in the files inside the directory and we use git for that purpose.
   In order to track the files inside that directory, we have to inform git to start tracking the files inside 
   the directory. 
   The file inside the particular directory will be tracked only when a git repository is 
   initialized in that directory. this is done using "git init" command.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

A.Staging area contains the files which will form part of a commit.
  The difference between the repository & staging area is that repository contains all the previous commits 
  along with the latest commit while the staging area contains only the files that will form part of the latest
  commit in the repository. 
  it is not nesseccary that all files in the working directory be added to staging area
  every-time we need to make a commit. only those files are added which are changed or some valuable change is made.

  Staging area provides us the freedom to choose only those files which we think to be added to the commit
