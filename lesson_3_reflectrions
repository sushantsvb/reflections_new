When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. It is possible that i may want to access my files when i dont have my own computer/laptop with me
   in such cases if there is another system available with internet connection i can still access my files
   since, i have also stored all of my files on a remote repository.
   also, if one day my system totally crashes and i can't use it, at such times having my files stored on a 
   remote repository along with a local repository will be of great advantage.
