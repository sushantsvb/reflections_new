When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. It is possible that i may want to access my files when i dont have my own computer/laptop with me
   in such cases if there is another system available with internet connection i can still access my files
   since, i have also stored all of my files on a remote repository.
   also, if one day my system totally crashes and i can't use it, at such times having my files stored on a 
   remote repository along with a local repository will be of great advantage.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. Although i don't have a clear idea about why pulling changes manually would help me but i think since there may be many other people who might
   have made changes to the file on remote. syncing those changes automatically with the loacl repository is not desired for tis purpose 
   i may prefer pulling changes manually.
